### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

*My name's Ismail and I'm soon about to **graduate from my Software Engineering degree** from the University of Huddersfield in the UK. I am expected to achieve a **first class degree**, and therefore I am excited to look for my first graduate role! I have experience in various technologies (see my work below), and I am grounded in the fundementals of Computer Science which I have demonstrated through my **high marks** during my degree, and by being a **data structures and algorithms teacher** for the Google Student Developer Club!*

**Academic Achievements during my degree:**

- 100% in SQL Databases  
- 100% in Hardware and Networks (Examination)
- 100% in Computational Mathematics (Year 2 end of year examination)
- 83% in Final year Arificial Intelligence 
- 85% in first year Mathematics exam 

**All recordings of my weekly Data Structures and Algorithms sessions are available upon request. I am preparing my students (along with myself) to participate in various coding contests** 

** *Currently applying to Graduate/Junior Software Engineer Roles* **
