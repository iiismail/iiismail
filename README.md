### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Ismail and I'm soon about to graduate from my Software Engineering degree from the University of Huddersfield in the UK. I am expected to achieve a first class degree, and therefore I am excited to look for my first graduate role! I have experience in various technologies (see my work below), and I am grounded in the fundementals of Computer Science which I have demonstrated through my high marks during my degree, and by being a data structures nd algorithms teacher for the Google Student Developer Club!
